# Contributing

This should be considered alpha software to be used at your own risk - it has the capability of overwriting dashboards, so ensure any existing dashboards are backed up first.

This tool was written to serve our own purposes, and so there are obvious gaps in the implementation. Any contributions welcome, including testing on various platforms, Grafana versions, and python versions.

Tested with:
    - Python 3.8, 3.9
    - Grafana v8.2.3
